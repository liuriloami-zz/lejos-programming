# Lejos Programming

LeJOS is a firmware replacement for Lego Mindstorms programmable bricks. This repository has some programs implemmented by Matheus Connolyn and I, as part of our Mobile Robotics module at Dublin Institute of Technology.

## Assignment 1

1. Print "Assignment 1" on the screen
2. Wait for a button to be pressed
3. Clear the screen
4. Wait for clapping and print "Claps" on the screen when it happens
5. Move forward until detecting a light surface underneath
6. Turn 90 degrees to the left
7. Move forward until a hard surface is detected by sonar at less than 25 cm distante
8. Stop and turn 180 degrees
9. Move forward 20 units, then stop
10. Turn 90 degrees to the right
11. Move forward until the touch sensor causes the robot to stop.
12. Print "Stop" on the screen.

## Assignment 2

1. Do a recognition lap around a room, at about 20 units distance from the walls (depending on your robot’s size)
2. Cover all the floor area in parallel movements, 7 units distant from each other.
  - It should avoid any obstacles found in the room.
  - It should also recognize when it’s going through a carpet (material of different colour
from the floor). When it does, it should beep and print “Carpet” on the screen.
3. If it bumps into something, it should stop – this is also the exit condition from the program.
